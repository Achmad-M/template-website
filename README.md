# Project Documentation

## Introduction

This project utilizes various libraries and stylesheets to enhance both the visual and interactive aspects of the website. Below is a detailed explanation of the differences between stylesheets and JavaScript libraries, followed by a table listing all the libraries and stylesheets used in this project, along with their functionality and links to their respective documentation.

## Differences Between Stylesheets and JavaScript Libraries for Websites

When building a website, it's essential to understand the distinct roles of stylesheets and JavaScript libraries. Both serve crucial but different functions in web development:

- **Stylesheets**: These are primarily used to define the appearance and layout of web pages. They control the visual aspects, such as fonts, colors, spacing, and animations. Stylesheets are written in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and do not provide any interactive functionality; instead, they ensure the content is presented in an attractive and responsive manner.

- **JavaScript Libraries**: JavaScript libraries are collections of pre-written JavaScript code that simplify complex scripting tasks. They are used to add interactivity, manage dynamic content, handle events, and create animations on a web page. Unlike stylesheets, which only affect the appearance, JavaScript libraries can manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), respond to user actions, and communicate with servers.
